# hpffp: Haskell Programming from First Principles
A relatively unorganized smattering of solutions to exercsises in "Haskell Programming from Frist Principles". 

Uploading them here as evidence that I do, in fact, know a bit of Haskell :). This repository is unorganized; if you are looking for a better example of how I organize code for production projects, look in the apollo_* repositories.

If someone manages to stumble across this an finds it useful, I also have a deck of anki cards to share that covers various tidbits of haskell knowledge. Feel free to reach out.
